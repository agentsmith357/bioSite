    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <h3>Family, Work, and Life</h3>
    <p>My name is Jelani Jenkins, and I bring over 20 years of experience in the IT industry, specializing in Managed Services and DevOps. Currently, I serve as the Lead DevOps Engineer for Charter Communications, focusing on the Spectrum Enterprise segment of the business. My role involves developing and implementing innovative solutions to automate critical functions and processes across Managed Services team and Infrastructure and Operations organization.
    </p><p> I graduated from ITT Tech in 2002 with a Bachelor of Science in Information System Security and hold a broad range of industry certifications, including MCSE, MCDBA, MCPD, CCNP R&S, CCNA Wireless, CCNA DevOps, and CCIE R&S Written. These certifications, combined with my practical experience, have allowed me to stay at the forefront of IT and DevOps innovations throughout my career. Additionally, Iâ€™ve developed proficiency in a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including HTML, Java, JavaScript, jQuery, ASP.Net, Perl, Python, C#, and Bash. This diverse skill set has enabled me to tackle complex technical challenges and create impactful solutions.
        </p><p>One of the highlights of my career at Charter Communications was earning a patent for Automating Network Devices. <a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/20180115460" target="_blank" >Link to US Patent</a>. I developed a process that streamlined the staging and registration of devices, automating a traditionally manual task that saved the company 24 to 48 hours (about 4 days) of manual labor for each installation. This innovation improved operational efficiency and demonstrated the potential for automation to transform workflows in Managed Services.
        </p><p> Throughout my journey, I have faced challenges and setbacks that have taught me how to overcome the most devastating mistakes. These experiences have shaped me into a forward-thinking problem solver who continually seeks to learn and improve. I am now motivated to advance my education by pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Development at Bellevue University. This program will provide me with the opportunity to refresh my knowledge, deepen my expertise as an application developer, and explore new aspects of software engineering.</p>
